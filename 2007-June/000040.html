<PRE>Hi,

I have just subscribed to this mailinglist and this is my first posting.
I use a Linux Fedora system for making music and writing music scores.
I'm quite happy using my text editor (vim) to do my score writing. I have 
used programs like abcm2ps, mup, and lilypond with fine results.

That does not mean I'm not interested in graphical programs. In the past I 
have used Score Perfect Pro on an old Atari ST computer. I still think SPP 
has the best, easiest, and fastest, most intuitive user-interface of them 
all I have seen when it comes to entering notes and incidentals in the 
core using the mouse. Even if Finale and Sibelius have more power in 
geberal.


On Linux I have tried several GUI based score editors:

MusicEdit by dr. Herbert Walz:
 	+ quite stable, has been in development for quite some time
 	- entering notes very time consuming
 	- score output ugly and not professional looking
 	- developed by one person, not Open Source

Gscore:
 	- unstable, feature-poor, unfinished project
 	- sucks.

Noteedit:
 	+ Very useable
 	+ Nice user interface
 	+ import/export of different formats (ABC, Lilypond, MUP, MusicXML, MIDI)
 	- Not WYSIWYG
 	- heavily depends on KDE and TSE libs.
 	- Development stopped

MuseScore (mscore):
 	+ good looks
 	+ promising
 	+ WYSIWYG
 	+ Lilypond quality music font
 	+ already in a usable state
 	+ active devlopment
 	- not a finished project
 	- bugs and crashes

Canorus:
 	+ promising !
 	+ Active development
 	+ good concept
 	- very unfinished
 	- I will have to ask questions in this mailinglist: I need some
 	help to get started. I haven't succeeded entering even a simple
 	tune like &quot;Mary had a little lamb&quot; until now yet.

My conclusion: The mscore and canorus projects are the ones that I will 
follow. Both have a different concept. Both are interesting for me. Both 
are far from perfect yet.

And about &quot;Mary had a little lamb&quot;: I could use a small &quot;Getting Started&quot; 
document. Does this exist ?

But personally I think a user should be able to enter &quot;Mary had a little 
lamb&quot; without the need to read any docs. If he can't, something is wrong 
with the design of the GUI. For more complex operations I don't mind 
reading some docs.

Can anyone help me getting started ? I have sucesfully compiled and 
installed canorus-0.3.1 on fedora core 6.
