<PRE>Hi Zeelander,

I'm sending this on public mailing lists so others can read it as well.

I'll put your document on the wiki asap, but I have a pretty difficult
exam on Wednesday and I'm studying day and night until then. I read it
through and basically, it's not too difficult to make it happen. We need
the following support:
- different note heads with symbols above (circle for high hat for
example) - easy to be done, only needs some thinking about which code to
reuse and what to rewrite - different note heads is used in vocal music
as well for non-melodic events (like finger clapping)
- new staff with 1, 3 or whatever lines (easy to be done)
- drum clefs - easy to be done
- playback support - basically use midi channel 10 and map the notes to
midi pitches - but also needs to be thought about it how to do this nicely
- export / import of lilypond syntax for this (also enables printing
using Lily) - medium work to be done, but also needs some thinking about
in what degree are we going to support Lily syntax for this. Export
should be very well done, import, well as good as it could be done for
the given environment (no official Lily parser available inside Canorus).

I can't promise anything about drum suport for 0.4 - first we need some
more basic stuff to work flawlessly like undo/redo and copy/paste. Also
some GUI issues I didn't have time yet to do should be finally resolved
(popup menus, score viewport behaviour, keyboard shortcuts). But after
that - all the numerous features like note markings (fermata, staccato,
marcato), lines (cresc., decresc., 8va, 8bassa) and different contexts
(drum, guitar tablatures, figured bass) come. Let alone the needed GUI
for this and for some other stuff (like document layout, program settings).


Regards.
- Matev&#382;

&gt;<i> Hey,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wrote an article about drum notation, but i don't have access to the
</I>&gt;<i> wiki so i can't upload it. (I couldn't find the registration
</I>&gt;<i> functions, if there is one) Could you place it on the wiki so other
</I>&gt;<i> people can read it too, please? There's an attachment with all the
</I>&gt;<i> files. It contains the article and some pictures i copied from books
</I>&gt;<i> and songs. They are all numbered, you'll only have to insert them in
</I>&gt;<i> the right place (just like in the document)
</I>&gt;<i>
