<PRE>Hi,

while working with Canorus (R1130) I encountered some problems with lyrics 
contexts. Copy and paste of lyrics does not work. With the attached file, as 
I copied the lyrics of the first voice (Cantus) and inserted it to the second 
voice (Altus), the result was a total mess. The syllables were not displayed 
under notes at all, but anywhere. This can be resolved by saving, closing and 
re-opening the file. But still, there were notes without text in between. 
This can also be seen in the print preview (before and after the close-open 
precedure). Cutting and pasting parts to move syllables to the correct notes 
did not work either, so in the end I had to re-enter the text by hand. Then I 
copied the text of the first part of Altus to the clipboard, but on pasting 
it to Tenor, Canorus crashed completely with the following message:

ASSERT: &quot;!isEmpty()&quot; in file /usr/include/qt4/QtCore/qlist.h, line 248

Strangely, after I started Canorus again, the same operation did not crash the 
program again (but as above there were notes without text in between so I had 
to rearrange them).

By the way, it is very comlicated to switch from inserting notes to inserting 
the corresponding lyrics: you have to go to edit mode, click the 
corresponding lyrics context, click the &quot;La&quot; button and then click the lyrics 
context again. This should be simpler, e.g. with a shortcut to change from 
insert or edit mode to the lyrics of the currently selected/inserted note. 
Similary it should be easier to switch between the different lyrics contexts. 
Another thing: On inserting a lyrics context, by default it should be 
attributed to the staff directly above it instead of the first staff of the 
sheet, which is irritating.

With the attached file, I had yet another problem. After importing it from a 
MIDI file, I inserted a key signature, but that did not take effect in the 
output. The reason was that a hidden C major key signature was still present 
which can be &quot;blindfold&quot; clicked and changed to the desired key signature. 
This can be still seen in the Cantus voice (I have corrected it for the other
voices).

Andreas
