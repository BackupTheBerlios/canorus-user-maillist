<PRE>Hi again and thanks for the replies! I've actually been using NoteEdit
this whole semester for a composition class, and it's been very
useful. My only complaint is that some things can only be done in
Lilypond, and then there's no way to import those changes back into to
NoteEdit. For instance, I wanted my staves labeled with the name of
the instruments...this displayed in NoteEdit, but did not export in
Lilypond. So I got my score ready, exported to Lilypond, made the
changes in Lilypond so the staves were labeled, and then converted to
PDF at the command line. Then I wanted to add some slurs, change a few
notes, and move some dynamics. Well, it's pain to do this in Lilypond,
so I fire up my .not file, and make the changes, but of course I have
to export to Lilypond and label the staves again! So I end up doing a
lot of work twice since NoteEdit doesn't import Lilypond. Maybe I
should learn MusicXML instead? It seems more complicated. I just don't
want to have to repeat a lot of work whenever I want to make some
minute changes to the score. How do ya'll get around these quirks?

About the EEE PC, yes, it's a fantastic machine, and the screenspace
isn't as limiting as you might think. It run Xandros, and NoteEdit is
in the repos...but it requires an upgrade of kde-libs which is
uninstallable (I hear upgrading kde libs breaks the eee) so I'm not
quite sure how to install it yet. Currently using Denemo, which isn't
bad, but not as mature as NoteEdit IMHO.

Can't wait for Canorus!

</PRE>
