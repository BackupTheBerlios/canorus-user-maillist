&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Late in 2011 already I wish you all a happy new year 2011.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the last 24 months I have seen that I cannot put that much time into
</I>&gt;<i> Canorus as I wish to. Reasons for that are just private life. Having a
</I>&gt;<i> full time job as software developer leaves it's traces. Most often I
</I>&gt;<i> prefer to just calm down in the evening instead of coding or other project
</I>&gt;<i> work. The weekends are most often filled with other work (especially saturday)
</I>&gt;<i> and I find myself needing 1 day per week to relax (or at least try to).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I do not promise that from my side much dedication, at least not as much
</I>&gt;<i> as the project needs to continue being an innovate score editor. The leading
</I>&gt;<i> force was and I hope also will be in the future Matevz.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally I don't think I deserve the project leader role, so if anyone wishes
</I>&gt;<i> to take my part I'd go one step down to take the role as &quot;simple&quot; developer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I stop whining here and tell you about my personal plans for Canorus this
</I>&gt;<i> year:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Finally finish coding my keyboard shortcuts part
</I>&gt;<i> - Visiting the LAC in Mai (Ireland,Maynooth), do a bit of promoting work if
</I>&gt;<i>    I'm alone, maybe a workshop if some other developers are with me (and those
</I>&gt;<i>    are interested) and of course some hacking ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What won't happen from my side is
</I>&gt;<i> - GSoc: I don't see myself getting this done with my current workload
</I>&gt;<i> - Paper/Presentation for LAC: Simply said lack of topic for me, also I think
</I>&gt;<i>    that Matevz current work is much better suited for this.
</I>&gt;<i> Also deadline for paper is tomorrow, so the chance is low anyway for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See <A HREF="http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2011/">http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2011/</A> for all the glory details of the
</I>&gt;<i> coming conference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also as many more mobile devices (tablets, smart phones) hit the market I
</I>&gt;<i> asked myself if it is useful to have some kind of Canorus on such devices
</I>&gt;<i> as well. I haven't yet a clear idea how this could look like but certainly
</I>&gt;<i> different to the desktop UI. The question would be what does the composer
</I>&gt;<i> on a smartphone or small tablet (up to 7&quot;, on 10&quot; a fingerstylus friendly
</I>&gt;<i> version of the desktop UI could be enough).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So there's keyboard shortcuts, LAC, and brainstorming about UI on my
</I>&gt;<i> side, after that maybe I try to work on export/import.
</I>
I'm still hoping that at some point Canorus won't crash when I try to 
save a file (Fedora).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have a good time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Reinhard
