<PRE>Hi,

Late in 2011 already I wish you all a happy new year 2011.

In the last 24 months I have seen that I cannot put that much time into
Canorus as I wish to. Reasons for that are just private life. Having a
full time job as software developer leaves it's traces. Most often I
prefer to just calm down in the evening instead of coding or other project
work. The weekends are most often filled with other work (especially saturday)
and I find myself needing 1 day per week to relax (or at least try to).

So I do not promise that from my side much dedication, at least not as much
as the project needs to continue being an innovate score editor. The leading
force was and I hope also will be in the future Matevz.

Finally I don't think I deserve the project leader role, so if anyone wishes
to take my part I'd go one step down to take the role as &quot;simple&quot; developer.

I stop whining here and tell you about my personal plans for Canorus this
year:

- Finally finish coding my keyboard shortcuts part
- Visiting the LAC in Mai (Ireland,Maynooth), do a bit of promoting work if
  I'm alone, maybe a workshop if some other developers are with me (and those
  are interested) and of course some hacking ;)

What won't happen from my side is
- GSoc: I don't see myself getting this done with my current workload
- Paper/Presentation for LAC: Simply said lack of topic for me, also I think
  that Matevz current work is much better suited for this.
Also deadline for paper is tomorrow, so the chance is low anyway for it.

See <A HREF="http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2011/">http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2011/</A> for all the glory details of the
coming conference.

Also as many more mobile devices (tablets, smart phones) hit the market I
asked myself if it is useful to have some kind of Canorus on such devices
as well. I haven't yet a clear idea how this could look like but certainly
different to the desktop UI. The question would be what does the composer
on a smartphone or small tablet (up to 7&quot;, on 10&quot; a fingerstylus friendly
version of the desktop UI could be enough).

So there's keyboard shortcuts, LAC, and brainstorming about UI on my
side, after that maybe I try to work on export/import.

Have a good time.

Regards,

Reinhard
