</I>Hello Andreas,

nice that you tried that, and yes let's say it's a bug, not finished
yet. I also prefer inserting with my keyboard, depending on the kind of
music.

When coding this I didn't manage to insert notes at a selected place,
but hopefully at the developers meeting at LAC I can learn the issues at
hand. And overall, the copying of voices to staffs is not yet generally
implemented. There's still work to be done. And settable bindings of
midi keys and commands to canorus editing would be nice to have, for shure.

When I input music with my midi keyboard i put only one voice per staff,
and, occasionally, pair them only in lilypond by scripting for now.

As a side note, I think we schould also have a mode of splitting and
tying not only at barlines but also at main beat times. This gives
sometimes better readable music.

Stay tuned,
Georg
