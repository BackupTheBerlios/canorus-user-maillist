<PRE>Hi,

as I recently used Canorus to write a short movement for four voices I noticed 
several insufficiencies about the UI:

I was not able to delete a note/rest in the middle of a bar. On deleting the 
note, a rest of equal length appeared, and trying to deleting that rest did 
nothing. On the other hand, one can easily insert a note causing an overfull 
bar which I couldn't repair without using undo.

In editing mode, the currently selected note should be changed in pitch when 
using the MIDI keyboard, just like it can be done with the arrow keys. At the 
moment, using the MIDI keyboard in editing mode inserts a note at the end of 
the line which is surely not what one expects. (In Franz' mail from yesterday 
I read that changing the pitch with MIDI keyboard is possible on playback 
which I did not expect either.) Also the pitch can't be changed chromatically 
with the arrow keys, so I found no way to change a note e.g. from f to f# in 
editing mode. Inserting f# with MIDI keyboard and deleting the f did not work 
either because the f could not be deleted, see above. Maybe changing the 
pitch chromatically could be done with shift-arrow or ctrl-arrow.

Changing between voices is very complicated. When I wanted to change notes 
e.g. in Tenor and Bass, I have to click the second line, click the field A in 
the toolbar twice to go to the second voice (e.g. Bass); after changing the 
note in Bass, I have to click on an another context, click the second line 
again and then the field with A once to activate the first voice before I can 
change a note in Tenor. It would be much easier to switch between voices (and 
lines) with arrow keys (in selection mode). By the way, are there keyboard 
shortcuts to change mode (e.g. from selection mode to editing mode)?

Andreas
