<PRE>Howdy!

I thought I'd mention some things about the UI that I found a bit confusing. Although I've been working with computers for a long time, I'm a perpetual newbie when it comes to learning how a new program works. I figure that it should &quot;just work the way I expect it to&quot;. So a number of things in the interface had me baffled.

0. Is there any tutorial on how this program works? I've looked on the website, I've clicked the &quot;Help&quot; button, but I've yet to find any sort of basic guide on how to use the software. Trust me - even doing basic things like inserting notes and rests isn't obvious. I understand this is beta software. but you should have at least one easily findable page showing how to enter a simple piece of music.


1. Inserting Notes and Rests. I clicked &quot;Insert Clef&quot; and got a dropdown. I clicked it to added a clef. Yay - so far so good. I'm feeling good about this software. I then clicked &quot;Insert Time signature&quot; and got a dropdown. Yay - another success. I inserted a time signature. I then clicked &quot;Insert Notes and Rests&quot; and got... nothing. Where's my dropdown of notes? My happiness level is quickly plummeting.

Eventually, I found the &quot;Playable Length&quot; dropdown at the top of the screen. Why the heck is it way up there? &quot;Insert Notes and Rests&quot; should have a dropdown on the left menu like everything else. Grumble, grumble.


2. Selecting a playable length. I clicked &quot;Playable Length&quot; and nothing happened. Well, I could see the button went down, but no menu appeared. Since the *only* reason I'd be clicking thjs button is to get the list of lengths (so I could select one), I don't understand why I have to click that little dropdown arrow. Why not have it appear when I click the button? This had me stuck for longer than I would care to admit.


3. Selecting a rest. I had no idea how to do this. I clicked the button with the rest on it, but nothing happened - I didn't even get a dropdown. I can see that it toggles, but I still got ordinary notes when I click on the staff. This sort of behavior is baffling. After a while, I moused over and saw that it says &quot;Hidden Rest&quot;, which means that it's not the control I want. So there's a button for adding &quot;hidden&quot; rests (whatever that is), but no way of inserting a &quot;normal&quot; rest. After clicking all over the UI, I was completely baffled (and frustrated). I know the software is beta, but there's *got* to be a way to get a rest on the staff.

Literally, I only just now figured out that clicking with the right mouse button - which is ordinarily reserved for a context menu in other programs - is used to insert a rest. Again,as a typically dumb user, my happiness level plummets when encountering this sort of setback. I want to be successful when using the software, not feeling like a complete idiot.


4. No key bindings in &quot;Insert&quot; mode. You've seen the requests from users: make Canorus behave like NWC. They're right. I prefer free software, but NWC is one of the few programs I've actually purchased. Well, asked for as a birthday present, anyway. It's almost the same thing, right?


5. No mouse editing on notes. This one really knocked me for a loop. Since you can only insert notes using the mouse, I figured that you'd only be able to edit using the mouse. But it's the exact opposite: the only thing you can do with notes in Edit mode it select them. Dragging a note doesn't move it, it causes the program to enter a &quot;group select&quot; mode. All the keys that don't do anything in Insert mode work perfectly in Edit mode.

Honestly, I don't really care that much about editing using the mouse. I actually *hate* having to use the mouse to enter in music. I'm just pointing out an inconsistency in the user experience. I'm a big fan of having software behave in a predictable sort of way, and Canorus doesn't seem to be at that point yet.


6. Creating chords. I don't know if Canorus lets me do this. I can click a quarter note underneath another quarter note, and they look like they're bound together into a chord. But if I do this with a flagged note, I get tow notes on the staff that are together on the same staff, but they don't share they each have their own flag. Does Canorus support chords yet?

Really, I want to like this software. It's got a lot of potential, but the UI experience is enough to drive away a idiot user like me.
