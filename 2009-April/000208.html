Basically I don't see any limitation. I don't know really the core but
Midi support certainly isn't finished at this point.

&gt;<i> I see that CAVoice has access to the MIDI channel and program. However, it appears that this setting is global for the voice. Does this mean that if I want to switch from bowed violins to pizzicato, I'd have to create another voice on the same staff?
</I>
I hope that's only the current implementation but our design goals are
always to keep the dependencies on each classes low (in this case
between voice and midi). So midi properties or objects will be at max
objectcs in the voice class (or there might be some midivoice sub
class in the future). The technical part aside though currently it seems 
to be that way I hope that it will change. Core developers can
tell you more about the design.

&gt;<i> I also don't see any way in CANote to set or adjust the velocity/volume of the instrument. This apparently means that all the voices play back at the same MIDI velocity? I assume that classes like CAFermata and CACrescendo are purely decorational?
</I>
I don't think this is implemented currently. AFAIK all core classes
currently are mainly for composing, printing and simple playback. Midi
dependencies probably will be added later in a way I explained above
(like CAMidiNote or an (optional) object included in CANote.

&gt;<i> There also appears to be no way to access MIDI controllers via events.
</I>
Some simple control was planned for the release but we lack developers
to do all this features we wish to have :(

&gt;<i> Are there plans for implementing support for this?
</I>
Certainly. Things you cannot find on our Wiki or on the feature request
page you can add yourself as suggestion (or even better design ideas and 
patches later :-)

Regards,

Reinhard
